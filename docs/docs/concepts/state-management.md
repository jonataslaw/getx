# State management

Get has two different state managers: the simple state manager (we'll call it GetBuilder) and the reactive state manager (GetX/Obx)

### Reactive State Manager

Reactive programming can alienate many people because it is said to be complicated. GetX turns reactive programming into something quite simple:

- You won't need to create StreamControllers.
- You won't need to create a StreamBuilder for each variable
- You will not need to create a class for each state.
- You will not need to create a get for an initial value.
- You will not need to use code generators

Reactive programming with Get is as easy as using setState.

Let's imagine that you have a name variable and want that every time you change it, all widgets that use it are automatically changed.

This is your count variable:

```dart
var name = 'Jonatas Borges';
```

To make it observable, you just need to add ".obs" to the end of it:

```dart
var name = 'Jonatas Borges'.obs;
```

And in the UI, when you want to show that value and update the screen whenever the values changes, simply do this:

```dart
Obx(() => Text("${controller.name}"));
```

That's all. It's _that_ simple.

### More details about state management

**See an more in-depth explanation of state management [here](/docs/pillars/state-management). There you will see more examples and also the difference between the simple state manager and the reactive state manager**

You will get a good idea of GetX power.
