# About GetX

- GetX is an extra-light and powerful solution for Flutter. It combines high-performance state management, intelligent dependency injection, and route management quickly and practically.

- GetX has 3 basic principles. This means that these are the priority for all resources in the library: **PRODUCTIVITY, PERFORMANCE AND ORGANIZATION.**

    - **PERFORMANCE:** GetX is focused on performance and minimum consumption of resources. GetX does not use Streams or ChangeNotifier.

    - **PRODUCTIVITY:** GetX uses an easy and pleasant syntax. No matter what you want to do, there is always an easier way with GetX. It will save hours of development and will provide the maximum performance your application can deliver.

      Generally, the developer should be concerned with removing controllers from memory. With GetX this is not necessary because resources are removed from memory when they are not used by default. If you want to keep it in memory, you must explicitly declare "permanent: true" in your dependency. That way, in addition to saving time, you are less at risk of having unnecessary dependencies on memory. Dependency loading is also lazy by default.

    - **ORGANIZATION:** GetX allows the total decoupling of the View, presentation logic, business logic, dependency injection, and navigation. You do not need context to navigate between routes, so you are not dependent on the widget tree (visualization) for this. You don't need context to access your controllers/blocs through an inheritedWidget, so you completely decouple your presentation logic and business logic from your visualization layer. You do not need to inject your Controllers/Models/Blocs classes into your widget tree through `MultiProvider`s. For this, GetX uses its own dependency injection feature, decoupling the DI from its view completely.

      With GetX you know where to find each feature of your application, having clean code by default. In addition to making maintenance easy, this makes the sharing of modules something that until then in Flutter was unthinkable, something totally possible.
      BLoC was a starting point for organizing code in Flutter, it separates business logic from visualization. GetX is a natural evolution of this, not only separating the business logic but the presentation logic. Bonus injection of dependencies and routes are also decoupled, and the data layer is out of it all. You know where everything is, and all of this in an easier way than building a hello world.
      GetX is the easiest, practical, and scalable way to build high-performance applications with the Flutter SDK. It has a large ecosystem around it that works perfectly together, it's easy for beginners, and it's accurate for experts. It is secure, stable, up-to-date, and offers a huge range of APIs built-in that are not present in the default Flutter SDK.

- GetX is not bloated. It has a multitude of features that allow you to start programming without worrying about anything, but each of these features are in separate containers and are only started after use. If you only use State Management, only State Management will be compiled. If you only use routes, nothing from the state management will be compiled.

- GetX has a huge ecosystem, a large community, a large number of collaborators, and will be maintained as long as the Flutter exists. GetX too is capable of running with the same code on Android, iOS, Web, Mac, Linux, Windows, and on your server.
  **It is possible to fully reuse your code made on the frontend on your backend with [Get Server](https://github.com/jonataslaw/get_server)**.

**In addition, the entire development process can be completely automated, both on the server and on the front end with [Get CLI](https://github.com/jonataslaw/get_cli)**.

**In addition, to further increase your productivity, we have the
[extension to VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=get-snippets.get-snippets) and the [extension to Android Studio/Intellij](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14975-getx-snippets)**

## Why Getx?

1- Many times after a Flutter update, many of your packages will break. Sometimes compilation errors happen, errors often appear that there are still no answers about, and the developer needs to know where the error came from, track the error, only then try to open an issue in the corresponding repository, and see its problem solved. Get centralizes the main resources for development (State, dependency and route management), allowing you to add a single package to your pubspec, and start working. After a Flutter update, the only thing you need to do is update the Get dependency, and get to work. Get also resolves compatibility issues. How many times a version of a package is not compatible with the version of another, because one uses a dependency in one version, and the other in another version? This is also not a concern using Get, as everything is in the same package and is fully compatible.

2- Flutter is easy, Flutter is incredible, but Flutter still has some boilerplate that may be unwanted for most developers, such as `Navigator.of(context).push (context, builder [...]`. Get simplifies development. Instead of writing 8 lines of code to just call a route, you can just do it: `Get.to(Home())` and you're done, you'll go to the next page. Dynamic web urls are a really painful thing to do with Flutter currently, and that with GetX is stupidly simple. Managing states in Flutter, and managing dependencies is also something that generates a lot of discussion, as there are hundreds of patterns in the pub. But there is nothing as easy as adding a ".obs" at the end of your variable, and place your widget inside an Obx, and that's it, all updates to that variable will be automatically updated on the screen.

3- Ease without worrying about performance. Flutter's performance is already amazing, but imagine that you use a state manager, and a locator to distribute your blocs/stores/controllers/ etc. classes. You will have to manually call the exclusion of that dependency when you don't need it. But have you ever thought of simply using your controller, and when it was no longer being used by anyone, it would simply be deleted from memory? That's what GetX does. With SmartManagement, everything that is not being used is deleted from memory, and you shouldn't have to worry about anything but programming. You will be assured that you are consuming the minimum necessary resources, without even having created a logic for this.

4- Actual decoupling. You may have heard the concept "separate the view from the business logic". This is not a peculiarity of BLoC, MVC, MVVM, and any other standard on the market has this concept. However, this concept can often be mitigated in Flutter due to the use of context.
If you need context to find an InheritedWidget, you need it in the view, or pass the context by parameter. I particularly find this solution very ugly, and to work in teams we will always have a dependence on View's business logic. Getx is unorthodox with the standard approach, and while it does not completely ban the use of StatefulWidgets, InitState, etc., it always has a similar approach that can be cleaner. Controllers have life cycles, and when you need to make an APIREST request for example, you don't depend on anything in the view. You can use onInit to initiate the http call, and when the data arrives, the variables will be populated. As GetX is fully reactive (really, and works under streams), once the items are filled, all widgets that use that variable will be automatically updated in the view. This allows people with UI expertise to work only with widgets, and not have to send anything to business logic other than user events (like clicking a button), while people working with business logic will be free to create and test the business logic separately.

This library will always be updated and implementing new features. Feel free to offer PRs and contribute to them.
